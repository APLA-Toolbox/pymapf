"""Centralised, kinematics-aware docking of a quadrotor fleet.

A fleet is hovering; a set of docking stations sits on the ground; every
quadrotor must land on one without any two coming closer than their bodies
allow. Three optimisations, stacked:

1. **Assignment** -- which quadrotor takes which station. Solved exactly
   with the Hungarian algorithm on flight distance, so the fleet as a whole
   travels least and nobody crosses the formation to reach a pad someone
   else is above (Turpin, Michael and Kumar's CAPT makes the case that this
   choice is what removes most conflicts before any trajectory is planned).
2. **Routing** -- a MAPF solver plans conflict-free routes through the
   :class:`~pymapf.core.voxel.VoxelGrid` the airspace is discretised into.
   CBS by default, so the routes are optimal for the assignment.
3. **Timing** -- :func:`~pymapf.kinodynamic.plan_trajectories` turns the
   routes into trajectories under the fleet's speed and acceleration limits,
   flying straight stretches as single runs and deriving the delay at every
   hand-over from the two vehicles' actual motion. The result is a set of
   continuous trajectories with a guaranteed separation at every shared
   waypoint, and a sampled separation over the whole flight as the check.

The ground layer of the airspace is blocked everywhere except the pads, so a
route can only touch the ground at a station: the last leg of every
trajectory is a vertical descent onto its pad, and no vehicle ever passes
over a pad at ground level on its way somewhere else.
