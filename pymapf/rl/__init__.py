"""Reinforcement learning on the same MAPF instances the planners solve.

The point of putting RL *inside* this library rather than beside it is that the
hard part of a learned-MAPF paper is usually the part this repository already
owns: correct instances, correct conflict semantics, and an optimal baseline to
be measured against. A rollout here comes back as a
:class:`pymapf.Solution` -- the same type CBS returns -- so "did the policy
solve it" and "how far off optimal was it" are answered by the planner's own
code::

    from pymapf.rl import MAPFEnv, make_trainer, evaluate

    env = MAPFEnv("random_obstacles", n_agents=4, width=10, height=10)
    trainer = make_trainer("mappo", env)
    trainer.learn(total_steps=200_000)
    print(evaluate(env, trainer.policy, episodes=100, baseline="cbs"))

Everything is a registry, matching the rest of the library: observations,
rewards and algorithms are all chosen by name and extended from outside with a
decorator, so adding a new encoding or a new learner does not mean editing this
package.
