"""Reward functions, as swappable objects.

The interesting one here is :class:`ShapedReward`, and it is interesting
because of something this library happens to own: an *exact* distance-to-goal
oracle. :func:`pymapf.core.heuristics.true_distance` runs a backward Dijkstra
over the real grid, so it knows the true remaining cost from every cell,
obstacles and all -- not a Manhattan guess.

That makes **potential-based shaping** available in its strong form. Ng, Harada
and Russell (1999) proved that a shaping term of the form

    ``F(s, s') = gamma * Phi(s') - Phi(s)``

leaves the optimal policy unchanged, for *any* potential ``Phi``. It is the one
kind of reward engineering that cannot quietly teach the agent the wrong task.
Taking ``Phi(s) = -true_distance(s)`` turns the sparse "you arrived" signal into
a dense one without changing what "arrived" is worth, and on grid MAPF the
difference between the two is the difference between learning something and
learning nothing: with sparse rewards a random policy essentially never reaches
a goal, so there is no gradient to follow.

The shaping is applied per agent on its own progress, which keeps it
decentralized -- an agent needs only its own distance-to-go, which it could
compute onboard from a map it already has.

Registry, like everything else::

    MAPFEnv(scenario, reward="shaped")
    MAPFEnv(scenario, reward=ShapedReward(collision=-2.0))

    ``Phi(s) = -distance_to_goal(s)`` using the library's own backward-Dijkstra
    oracle, so the potential is the true remaining cost rather than a straight
    line through walls. The shaping term ``gamma * Phi(s') - Phi(s)`` is
    policy-invariant (Ng et al. 1999): it changes how fast the policy learns,
    not what it converges to, which is the property that makes it safe to use
    when the whole point is to compare against an optimal planner.

    One implementation note. Cells with no path to the goal have infinite
    potential; those are clamped to the largest finite distance rather than
    propagating an infinity into the return. An agent that walks into a sealed
    pocket should get a bad reward, not a NaN.

    Args:
        gamma: must match the discount the learner uses, or the invariance
            argument does not hold.
        scale: multiplies the shaping term. 1.0 keeps the theoretical guarantee;
