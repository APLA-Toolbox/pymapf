"""MAPF as a multi-agent reinforcement learning environment.

This follows the **PettingZoo Parallel API** -- ``reset`` returning
``(observations, infos)``, ``step`` taking a dict of actions and returning five
dicts -- because that is the interface every current MARL library speaks. It
implements that API without importing PettingZoo, so the environment still runs
in a bare CI job; :meth:`MAPFEnv.to_pettingzoo` wraps it in the real
``ParallelEnv`` when the package is installed.

What makes this worth building rather than reaching for an existing gridworld
is the last method on the class: :meth:`MAPFEnv.solution`. A rollout comes back
as a :class:`pymapf.Solution` -- the *same* object CBS returns -- so a learned
policy and an optimal planner are scored by identical code, on identical
instances, under identical conflict rules. Not a reimplementation of
sum-of-costs that agrees with the planner's if you read both carefully: the
planner's own.

Transition semantics
--------------------

Agents move simultaneously, and the conflict rules are MAPF's, not a
gridworld's approximation of them:

* a move into a wall or off the map is refused (``blocked``);
* two agents claiming the same cell is a **vertex conflict** -- both are
  refused (``collided``);
* two agents exchanging cells is an **edge conflict**, refused likewise, which
  is the rule a naive "check the destination is empty" implementation misses;
* refusals **cascade**. An agent pushed back onto its current cell can invalidate
  a third agent that was moving into the cell it was about to vacate, so
  resolution iterates to a fixed point rather than resolving once.

Agents are never deleted mid-episode, and an agent sitting on its goal may move
off it again -- sometimes it must, to let someone through. The episode
terminates the moment every agent is simultaneously on its goal, which is
exactly the condition a MAPF plan has to satisfy.

    """A MAPF instance as a parallel multi-agent environment.

    Args:
        scenario: a :class:`pymapf.Scenario`, a :class:`pymapf.MAPFProblem`, or
            the name of a registered scenario family.
        observation: encoder name or instance (see
            :mod:`pymapf.rl.observation`).
        reward: reward function name or instance (see :mod:`pymapf.rl.reward`).
        max_steps: truncation horizon. Defaults to a multiple of the grid
            diagonal, which scales with the instance instead of being a number
            that silently becomes too small on bigger maps.
        randomise: draw a fresh instance from the scenario family on every
            ``reset``. This is what makes a policy generalise rather than
            memorise one map, so it is on by default when a family name is
            given.
        lifelong: an agent that reaches its goal is immediately given a new
            one, drawn from the free cells it can reach that nobody else is
            standing on or heading for. The episode never terminates -- it
            runs to ``max_steps`` -- and the number that matters is
            **throughput**, goals completed per step, reported in the episode
            summary as ``throughput`` and ``goals_completed``. This is the
            problem deployed fleets solve (Li et al. 2021, RHCR), and the
            one-shot objective is not an approximation of it: sum-of-costs
            is undefined when nothing terminates.
        scenario_kwargs: forwarded to :func:`pymapf.build_scenario` when
            ``randomise`` is drawing new instances.
