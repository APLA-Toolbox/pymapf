"""Scoring learned policies against the planners, on the planners' terms.

This is the part that is hard to do honestly without owning the domain, and
easy once you do. Every learned rollout comes back as a
:class:`pymapf.Solution`, so:

* **validity** is checked by ``Solution.is_valid()`` -- the same conflict
  detector that validates CBS output. A learned policy cannot quietly score
  well by producing paths that overlap;
* **cost** is ``sum_of_costs`` from the same property, on paths trimmed the
  same way;
* and because CBS is *optimal*, the ratio of the two is a **suboptimality
  ratio against ground truth**, not against another heuristic. Most learned-MAPF
  numbers are success rates, because the optimum is expensive to obtain. Here it
  is one call.

The instances are shared: every method is run on the identical problem, so the
comparison never turns on one method getting easier maps. Instances that the
optimal planner cannot solve within its time limit are reported separately
rather than counted as learned-policy wins.
