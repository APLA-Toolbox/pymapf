"""Joint trajectory optimisation in continuous space.

The rest of this library plans *paths* on graphs and times them afterwards.
This package plans **trajectories**: polynomials of time in R^n, optimised
for the whole fleet at once, with no grid anywhere::

    from pymapf.trajectory import Vehicle, plan_joint_trajectories

    fleet = [Vehicle("a", (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 10.0), radius=0.3),
             Vehicle("b", (10.0, 0.0), (0.0, 10.0), radius=0.3)]
    plan = plan_joint_trajectories(fleet, v_max=2.0, a_max=4.0,
                                   obstacles=[((5.0, 5.0), 1.2)])

    plan.trajectories["a"](3.2)             # position, metres
    plan.trajectories["a"](3.2, 1)          # velocity
    plan.min_separation()                   # (distance, time, pair)
    plan.is_safe(), plan.max_speed()

Seed it from a discrete plan when the routing decision matters::

    from pymapf.trajectory import waypoints_from_solution

    solution = pymapf.solve(scenario.to_problem(), "cbs")
    plan = plan_joint_trajectories(fleet, waypoints=waypoints_from_solution(solution))

Requires numpy. See :mod:`pymapf.trajectory.joint` for the formulation and
:mod:`pymapf.trajectory.qp` for the solver it is built on.
