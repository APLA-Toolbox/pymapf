"""Joint trajectory optimisation for a fleet, in continuous space.

Every other planner in this library reasons about a *path*: a sequence of
vertices on a graph, timed afterwards. This one optimises the whole fleet's
**trajectories** directly -- vector-valued polynomials of time in R^n, with
no grid anywhere -- and it optimises them *jointly*: one problem whose
decision variables are every vehicle's polynomial coefficients at once, whose
objective is the fleet's total effort, and whose constraints couple the
vehicles to each other.

    minimise    Σ_i ∫ ‖p_i⁽ᵈ⁾(t)‖² dt                    (snap, by default)
    subject to  p_i(0) = start_i,  p_i(T) = goal_i,      and derivatives at rest
                p_i is C^k across its knots
                ‖p_i(t) - p_j(t)‖ >= r_i + r_j           for all pairs, all t
                ‖p_i(t) - o‖     >= r_i + r_o            for every obstacle
                ‖ṗ_i(t)‖ <= v_max,  ‖p̈_i(t)‖ <= a_max

The cost and the equalities are convex; the separation constraints are not
-- "stay at least this far apart" is the complement of a ball. The standard
remedy, and the one used here, is **sequential convex programming**: at each
iteration, replace each separation constraint by the half-space that
supports it at the current iterate,

    n̂ᵀ(p_i(t) - p_j(t)) >= r_i + r_j,     n̂ = (p_i(t) - p_j(t)) / ‖·‖

which is linear, and *conservative* -- a point satisfying it satisfies the
true constraint, since the half-space is contained in the feasible set. Solve
the resulting convex program, re-linearise, repeat, with a trust region so
the linearisation stays valid. That is Augugliaro, Schoellig and D'Andrea's
formulation for quadrocopter fleets (IROS 2012), and Chen, Cutler and How's
(ICRA 2015) for the same idea with a discrete plan as the seed.

Three things are worth knowing about this implementation.

**The equalities are eliminated once, not solved every iteration.** Boundary
conditions and continuity do not change between iterations, so the affine
set they define is factored once into a particular solution and an
orthonormal null-space basis; every subproblem is then solved in the reduced
coordinates. On a six-vehicle instance that turns a 816-dimensional
saddle-point system into a 144-dimensional one, which is the difference
between seconds and milliseconds per iteration.

**Speed and acceleration are met exactly, by dilating time.** Their
linearised constraints are an *outer* approximation (the bound is convex, so
its tangent plane lies outside it), so the optimiser can finish a hair over
the limit. Rather than pretend otherwise, the result is time-dilated by the
smallest factor that brings both within bounds. Dilation is safe in a way no
other repair is: it scales every vehicle's clock by the same factor, so the
fleet's geometry at corresponding times -- and therefore every pairwise
separation -- is exactly preserved.

**A discrete plan makes a good seed.** :func:`waypoints_from_solution` turns
any :class:`~pymapf.Solution` into the waypoint lists this optimiser starts
from, which is how a fleet gets a *globally* sensible homotopy (which side of
the obstacle, who goes first) from a complete MAPF solver before the
continuous optimiser makes it smooth and fast. Without a seed the initial
guess is a straight line, and the optimiser will find a way around convex
obstacles but has no way to reason about which way *around* is better.

    """Optimise every vehicle's trajectory at once, in continuous space.

    Args:
        vehicles: the fleet. All must share a dimension.
        duration: the fleet's makespan in seconds. ``None`` sizes it from the
            longest seed path at ``0.7 * v_max``, leaving room to accelerate
            and to detour.
        segments: polynomial pieces per vehicle when no waypoints are given;
            with waypoints, each leg is a segment.
        order: polynomial degree per piece. 7 is the classical choice for a
            snap objective -- eight coefficients, enough for position,
            velocity, acceleration and jerk at both ends of a segment.
        minimise: the derivative whose square is integrated. 4 is snap
            (Mellinger and Kumar's objective, the one a quadrotor's inputs
            are flat in), 3 is jerk, 2 acceleration.
        v_max / a_max: fleet limits; a vehicle may override either.
        obstacles: ``(centre, radius)`` spheres to stay clear of.
        clearance: extra metres required beyond the radii, for both
            vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-obstacle separation.
        waypoints: ``{name: points}`` to seed from -- see
            :func:`waypoints_from_solution`. Interior waypoints are *not*
            pinned in the optimisation; they set the time allocation and the
            initial guess, and the optimiser is free to leave them.
        samples: times at which the constraints are enforced, over the whole
            flight. The guarantee is at these times; the result's
            :meth:`JointPlan.min_separation` samples much more finely, and
            the tests check that the two agree.
        iterations: outer convex iterations.
        trust_region: how far the coefficients may move per iteration,
            shrunk when a step makes the true constraints worse.
        boundary: derivatives held at zero at the start and the goal.
        continuity: highest derivative matched across an internal knot.
        tolerance: convergence, on the worst constraint violation in metres.
        cost_tolerance: convergence, on the relative change in the objective
            between iterations; two settled iterations in a row stop the loop.
        inter_sample: require the separation constraints to hold *between*
            the sample times too, by the bound in :func:`_linearise`. Turning
            it off enforces them only at the samples, which is cheaper and
            what the literature usually reports -- and lets a pair dip below
            the requirement between two samples, which the tests demonstrate.
        enforce_limits: dilate time at the end so that the speed and
            acceleration limits hold exactly. See the module docstring for
            why this is safe.

    Returns:
        A :class:`JointPlan`.

            names, a vehicle starting inside another) or an impossible

        trajectories pay for a conflict that never happens.
