"""Formation control: hold a *shape*, not just a heading.

Flocking asks a swarm to move together; coverage asks it to spread out;
formation control asks for something stricter -- a specified geometry, held
while the group moves. A camera array that must keep its baseline, a lift team
carrying one object, an inspection line sweeping a wall: all of them need the
relative positions to be right, not merely collision-free.

What makes this more than "fly to your assigned point" is **what each agent is
allowed to know**. The three constraint types below need progressively less, and
each buys its weaker sensing with a weaker guarantee -- which is the whole
design space:

``displacement``
    Agents measure relative *positions* in a **common orientation** (a shared
    compass or north reference). Simplest and stiffest; the formation is fixed
    in translation only, so the group can drift but not rotate or scale.

``distance``
    Agents measure only inter-agent *distances* -- no shared frame at all. The
    shape is then defined up to rotation, translation and reflection, and holding
    it requires the graph to be **rigid**: enough distance constraints that no
    continuous deformation preserves them all. This module checks that.

``bearing``
    Agents measure only *directions* to neighbours (what a camera gives you).
    The shape is defined up to translation and **scale**, so a bearing-based
    formation can breathe -- which is a feature when the group must squeeze
    through a gap, and a bug when the baseline matters.

A fourth controller, ``leader_follower``, is the pragmatic one: designated
leaders track whatever trajectory you like and everyone else maintains an offset
from them. It composes with any flocking behavior, because leaders and followers
are just agents with different gains.

Shapes are objects too (:class:`FormationShape`), so "V of nine drones" and
"cube of eight" are one line each, and matching agents to slots is an explicit,
optimal assignment rather than an accident of indexing.

    The fit matters, and it is the whole reason this function takes flags. A

    distance-based controller and a *failure* for a displacement-based one. One
    that is perfect but twice the size is a success for a bearing-based
    controller and a failure for both of the others. One that is a perfect
    mirror image is a success for a distance-based controller and nothing else,
    because distances cannot see handedness. So the comparison is made under
    exactly the transformation group the controller is entitled to: translation
    always, and rotation, uniform scale and reflection each optionally. Every
    controller declares its own group -- :attr:`~_FormationBase.allow_rotation`,
    :attr:`~_FormationBase.allow_scaling`, :attr:`~_FormationBase.allow_reflection`
    -- and :meth:`_FormationBase.error` uses it, so no controller is ever graded
    on a symmetry it was never given the sensing to fix.

    Fit and correspondence are solved *together*. Procrustes needs to know which
    agent holds which slot, and the assignment needs to know the pose -- solving
    either one first with the other guessed is how a formation that has hit its
    target exactly gets scored as a failure. This alternates the two (Procrustes
    given the assignment, Hungarian given the pose) to a fixed point, which takes
    two or three rounds; ``iterations`` caps it.

    Alternation only finds a *local* optimum, and seeding it from the identity
    pose is a bad start when the formation is substantially rotated: the first
    assignment is then made against a target pointing the wrong way, and the
    pair can lock there. So the descent is restarted from several initial
    correspondences and the best fit wins (see :func:`_seed_assignments`). The
    cost is a handful of extra Hungarian solves on a matrix the size of the
    swarm, which is nothing.
