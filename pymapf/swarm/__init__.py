"""Decentralized swarm control: flocking, formation, coverage and distribution.

The centralized planners in :mod:`pymapf.algorithms` assume a graph, a central
solver and full information. This package is the other half: continuous space,
local sensing, no coordinator. It is built on the same conventions -- an
abstract base class per algorithm family, a name registry, and swappable
strategy objects -- so a controller is chosen with a string and compared with a
loop::

    from pymapf.swarm import SwarmSimulator, available_behaviors

    for name in available_behaviors():
        result = SwarmSimulator(name, n_agents=20).run(steps=300)
        print(name, result.metrics.summary())

Four families:

**Flocking** (:mod:`~pymapf.swarm.flocking`) -- move as a group. Ten control
laws from Reynolds' boids to the 2024 minimalistic model that flocks on relative
range and bearing alone, all composable via
:class:`~pymapf.swarm.base.CompositeBehavior` and all able to use any
:class:`~pymapf.swarm.neighborhood.Neighborhood` strategy.

**Formation** (:mod:`~pymapf.swarm.formation`) -- hold a *shape*, not just a
heading. Organised by what each agent is allowed to measure -- relative
position, range, or bearing -- because that is what decides which symmetry the
controller can fix. Includes the rigidity test that says whether a target shape
is holdable at all.

**Coverage** (:mod:`~pymapf.swarm.coverage`) -- spread out to watch an area.
Lloyd descent and its variants, over a pluggable
:class:`~pymapf.swarm.domain.Domain`, so the same controller deploys a team on a
plane, a sphere, a hemisphere or an annulus.

**Distribution control** (:mod:`~pymapf.swarm.distribution`) -- shape the swarm
into a target *density* rather than assigning individual goals, which is what
scales to hundreds of agents.
