"""PyMAPF: a toolbox for multi-agent path finding and planning.

The :mod:`pymapf.core` package defines the algorithm-agnostic framework
(``GridMap``, ``MAPFProblem``, ``Solution``, ``MAPFSolver`` and a solver
registry). Concrete centralized algorithms live in :mod:`pymapf.algorithms` and
register themselves by name, so they can be obtained via :func:`get_solver`::

    import pymapf

    grid = pymapf.GridMap([[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]])
    problem = pymapf.MAPFProblem(grid, [
        pymapf.Agent("a", (0, 0), (2, 2)),
        pymapf.Agent("b", (2, 0), (0, 2)),
    ])
    solution = pymapf.solve(problem, "cbs")
    print(solution.paths, solution.sum_of_costs)

The reactive/decentralized planners (NMPC, Velocity Obstacles) remain available
under :mod:`pymapf.decentralized`.
