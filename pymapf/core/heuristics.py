"""Pluggable, admissible grid heuristics.

All heuristics operate on integer cells of any dimension -- ``(row, col)`` on
a :class:`~pymapf.core.grid.GridMap`, ``(layer, row, col)`` on a
:class:`~pymapf.core.voxel.VoxelGrid`, and anything longer -- and return a
float estimate of the cost to travel between them. They are registered by name
so that solvers can be configured with a string (e.g. ``"manhattan"``) instead
of hard-coding a single global heuristic as the legacy ``common.HEURISTIC``
flag did.

Coordinate convention across the framework: a cell is ``(row, col)`` which maps
to ``grid[row][col]`` (i.e. ``(y, x)``); a voxel prepends the layer.

Which one is admissible depends on the move set and on the unit edge cost the
solvers use: ``manhattan`` for face-adjacent moves (4 on a plane, 6 in a
volume), ``chebyshev`` when diagonals are allowed (8 or 26), ``euclidean``
always. ``octile`` prices a planar diagonal at ``sqrt 2`` and so overestimates
under unit cost; it is kept for the classic grid-search convention.

    Runs one backward Dijkstra from the goal and closes over the resulting
