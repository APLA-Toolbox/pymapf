"""Constraint-aware space-time A* (the low-level search for MAPF solvers).

This is the shared single-agent primitive used by both Prioritized Planning and
Conflict-Based Search. It searches over ``(cell, time)`` states, honouring
vertex/edge :class:`~pymapf.core.solver.Constraints`, allowing *wait* actions,
and terminating on a provable upper bound so it can never loop forever (a
concrete failure mode of the legacy ``AStar``).
