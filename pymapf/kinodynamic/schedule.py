"""Turn a discrete MAPF plan into a kinematically feasible schedule.

The idea is Hönig et al.'s MAPF-POST (ICAPS 2016): keep the *order* in which
the discrete plan has agents visit each vertex, throw away its *timing*, and
re-derive the timing as the solution of a simple temporal network whose
constraints are physical rather than unit-step. Two kinds of constraint:

* **travel** -- an agent cannot leave a vertex before it has arrived there,
  and a move takes at least as long as its :class:`MotionProfile` says;
* **safety** -- if the discrete plan has agent A at vertex ``v`` before agent
  B, then B may arrive at ``v`` only ``safety_time`` seconds after A *starts to
  leave* it.

Every constraint has the form ``x >= y + w``, so the earliest schedule is the
longest path from a virtual source, found by Bellman-Ford. Using the moment A
*starts* leaving rather than the moment it has fully left is what makes
rotations feasible: three agents cycling around a loop all start at once, and
the spacing between them is the edge length. It also means the safety margin
cannot exceed a move's duration -- ask for more and the network has a positive
cycle, which :class:`InfeasibleScheduleError` reports as exactly that.

The paper's safety margin is one number. Here it is derived per hand-over by
:func:`required_margin`, which simulates A leaving and B arriving under their
actual profiles and the actual angle between the two moves, and finds the
smallest delay at which they never come within ``safety_distance``. That
matters because rest-to-rest profiles are slow at both ends: A creeps away
from the vertex while B creeps onto it, and a margin sized for full speed
lets a right-angle hand-over get far closer than asked. The tests check the
sampled minimum over whole plans against the distance requested.

**Straight runs.** By default every vertex is a halt: the agent comes to rest
at each cell, which is what makes each move's duration independent of the
next. With ``merge_straight=True`` consecutive collinear moves with no wait
between them become one *run* flown under one profile, and the vertices along
it are *passed through* at speed. The network stays linear because a run's
profile is fixed once its length is: the agent passes the k-th vertex of a
run a constant ``tau_k`` after the run departs, so "A passes ``v``" is still
the run's departure plus a constant, and every safety constraint is still a
difference. The hand-over margin is derived from the same simulation, now
with both agents moving through the vertex rather than starting or stopping
on it. This is the form a vehicle that can hover or coast wants: a quadrotor
does not land at every metre of a corridor.

There is one respect in which the margin is *not* a guarantee: it covers each
pair's hand-over at a shared vertex, not two agents passing on adjacent
vertices without ever sharing one. On a unit grid those keep one cell apart,
which is fine for ``safety_distance <= 1``; ask for more than the edge length
and :meth:`TrajectorySet.min_separation` is the check, as it is for anything
else this model does not see.

Deviations from the paper: profiles are rest-to-rest per run (the paper
allows any speed within limits, at the cost of a second bound per move and an
LP), and there is no upper bound on dwell, so an agent may wait indefinitely
for a slower one. Both are simplifications that keep the network a plain
longest-path problem and the core free of a solver dependency.
