"""The published site's data files must be readable by a browser.

`.docs/` is uploaded verbatim to GitHub Pages and the playground reads these
files at runtime, so a file that Python can write but `JSON.parse` cannot read
is a broken page rather than a failing build -- and nothing else catches it.

The specific trap: `json.dump` writes a bare ``NaN`` token for a non-finite
float. Python's own loader accepts it, so a round-trip in Python looks fine.
It is not JSON, and every browser rejects the whole document. `strict=False` is
therefore *not* what these tests want -- `parse_constant` is how you refuse it.
